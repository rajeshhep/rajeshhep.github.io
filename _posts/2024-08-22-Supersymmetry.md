title: "Supersymmetry in Quantum Mechanics"
---

Supersymmetry is a mathematical framework that describes the relationship between bosons and fermions. It is a symmetry that relates particles with integer spin (bosons) to particles with half-integer spin (fermions). The idea of supersymmetry was first introduced in the 1970s as a way to unify the fundamental forces of nature.
