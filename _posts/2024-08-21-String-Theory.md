# Heading

String theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to different particles. String theory is a leading candidate for a theory of quantum gravity, which would unify general relativity and quantum mechanics.
